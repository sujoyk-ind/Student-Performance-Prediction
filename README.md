# Student-Performance-Prediction
🚀 Exploring Linear Regression and Gradient Descent for Predictive Modeling 📊

I’ve just completed a hands-on project that dives deep into Linear Regression and Gradient Descent to model relationships between data points. Specifically, I focused on predicting final grades (G3) based on previous grades (G2) using a dataset of student performance.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Linear Regression: Built a linear model to predict student grades using the simplest form of regression.
Gradient Descent: Implemented the gradient descent algorithm from scratch to minimize the cost function and optimize the model parameters.
Visualization: Used scatter plots and regression lines to clearly see the model's predictions and performance.

💡 What I Learned:

The importance of data preprocessing for machine learning algorithms
How gradient descent iteratively minimizes error and adjusts parameters
Visualizing model performance to better understand its accuracy
